BERTopic generates topics from text through a four-step process:\n","\n","1. **Embedding**: Each document is first transformed into a numerical vector using a pre-trained language model such as BERT. This step captures the semantic meaning and contextual nuances of the text.\n","\n","2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Because the resulting vectors are high-dimensional, a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., UMAP) is applied to simplify the representation while preserving important structure, making clustering more efficient and effective.\n","\n","3. **Clustering**: The reduced vectors are then clustered into groups, where each cluster corresponds to a potential topic.\n","\n","4. **Topic Representation**: For each cluster, BERTopic applies a technique called class-based TF-IDF to identify the key words that best characterize the topic.\n","\n","This end-to-end process enables BERTopic to generate clear, interpretable, and contextually rich topics, often outperforming traditional topic modeling methods.\n","\n","![image.png](attachment:6c85ca13-6cfa-4a64-9443-bbe4b29e41c2.png)![image.png](attachment:4a208f14-75db-4b07-acb8-c0998be65fe9.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tIoe0NX6xOph"},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oronUo91z0zK"},"source":["##

Previous studies generally update signal timings in real-time based on predefined traffic measures collected by point detectors, such as traffic volumes and occupancies. Comparing with point detectors, traffic cameras-which have been increasingly deployed on road networks-could cover larger areas and provide more detailed traffic information. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to explore the potential of traffic video data in improving the efficiency of ramp metering. The proposed method uses traffic video frames as inputs and learns the optimal control strategies directly from the high-dimensional visual inputs. A real-world case study demonstrates that, in comparison with a state-of-the-practice method, the proposed DRL method results in 1) lower travel times in the mainline, 2) shorter vehicle queues at the on-ramp, and 3) higher traffic flows downstream of the merging area. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to extract useful information from the video data for better ramp metering controls.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}],"source":["docs[0]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DQuAsXuSRLMu"},"source":["`fetch_arXiv_abstracts` is a function from `utils/` that will return a certain number of abstracts from a category eg `cs.AI`.

In deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL), such optimization methods are often used for training neural networks via the temporal difference error or policy gradient. As an agent improves over time, the optimization target changes and thus the loss landscape (and local optima) change. Due to the failure modes of those methods, the ideal choice of optimizer for Deep RL remains unclear. As such, we provide an empirical analysis of the effects that a wide range of gradient descent optimizers and their hyperparameters have on policy gradient methods, a subset of Deep RL algorithms, for benchmark continuous control tasks. We find that adaptive optimizers have a narrow window of effective learning rates, diverging in other cases, and that the effectiveness of momentum varies depending on the properties of the environment. Our analysis suggests that there is significant interplay between the dynamics of the environment and Deep RL algorithm properties which aren't necessarily accounted for by traditional adaptive gradient methods. We provide suggestions for optimal settings of current methods and further lines of research based on our findings.\",\n          \"A number of problems in relational Artificial Intelligence can be viewed as Stochastic Constraint Optimization Problems (SCOPs). These are constraint optimization problems that involve objectives or constraints with a stochastic component. Building on the recently proposed language SC-ProbLog for modeling SCOPs, we propose a new method for solving these problems. Earlier methods used Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) techniques to create Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs), which were decomposed into smaller constraints in order to exploit existing constraint programming (CP) solvers. We argue that this approach has as drawback that a decomposed representation of an OBDD does not guarantee domain consistency during search, and hence limits the efficiency of the solver. For the specific case of monotonic distributions, we suggest an alternative method for using CP in SCOP, based on the development of a new propagator; we show that this propagator is linear in the size of the OBDD, and has the potential to be more efficient than the decomposition method, as it maintains domain consistency.\",\n          \"We consider decision problems under uncertainty where the options available to a decision maker and the resulting outcome are related through a causal mechanism which is unknown to the decision maker. We ask how a decision maker can learn about this causal mechanism through sequential decision making as well as using current causal knowledge inside each round in order to make better choices had she not considered causal knowledge and propose a decision making procedure in which an agent holds \\\\textit{beliefs} about her environment which are used to make a choice and are updated using the observed outcome. As proof of concept, we present an implementation of this causal decision making model and apply it in a simple scenario.

In deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL), such optimization methods are often used for training neural networks via the temporal difference error or policy gradient. As an agent improves over time, the optimization target changes and thus the loss landscape (and local optima) change. Due to the failure modes of those methods, the ideal choice of optimizer for Deep RL remains unclear. As such, we provide an empirical analysis of the effects that a wide range of gradient descent optimizers and their hyperparameters have on policy gradient methods, a subset of Deep RL algorithms, for benchmark continuous control tasks. We find that adaptive optimizers have a narrow window of effective learning rates, diverging in other cases, and that the effectiveness of momentum varies depending on the properties of the environment. Our analysis suggests that there is significant interplay between the dynamics of the environment and Deep RL algorithm properties which aren't necessarily accounted for by traditional adaptive gradient methods. We provide suggestions for optimal settings of current methods and further lines of research based on our findings.\",\n          \"A number of problems in relational Artificial Intelligence can be viewed as Stochastic Constraint Optimization Problems (SCOPs). These are constraint optimization problems that involve objectives or constraints with a stochastic component. Building on the recently proposed language SC-ProbLog for modeling SCOPs, we propose a new method for solving these problems. Earlier methods used Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) techniques to create Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs), which were decomposed into smaller constraints in order to exploit existing constraint programming (CP) solvers. We argue that this approach has as drawback that a decomposed representation of an OBDD does not guarantee domain consistency during search, and hence limits the efficiency of the solver. For the specific case of monotonic distributions, we suggest an alternative method for using CP in SCOP, based on the development of a new propagator; we show that this propagator is linear in the size of the OBDD, and has the potential to be more efficient than the decomposition method, as it maintains domain consistency.\",\n          \"We consider decision problems under uncertainty where the options available to a decision maker and the resulting outcome are related through a causal mechanism which is unknown to the decision maker. We ask how a decision maker can learn about this causal mechanism through sequential decision making as well as using current causal knowledge inside each round in order to make better choices had she not considered causal knowledge and propose a decision making procedure in which an agent holds \\\\textit{beliefs} about her environment which are used to make a choice and are updated using the observed outcome. As proof of concept, we present an implementation of this causal decision making model and apply it in a simple scenario. We show that the model achieves a performance similar to the classic Q-learning while it also acquires a causal model of the environment.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"docs_short\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Recent analyses of certain gradient descent optimization methods have shown that performance can deg...\",\n          \"A number of problems in relational Artificial Intelligence can be viewed as Stochastic Constraint Op...\",\n          \"We consider decision problems under uncertainty where the options available to a decision maker and ...\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}],"source":["df_plot = pd.DataFrame({\n","    \"x1\": [point[0] for point in reduced_embeddings],\n","    \"x2\": [point[1] for point in reduced_embeddings],\n","    \"docs\": docs,\n","})\n","\n","df_plot[\"docs_short\"] = df_plot[\"docs\"].str[:100] + \"...\"\n","df_plot.head(10)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":21,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":542},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2195,"status":"ok","timestamp":1763625536300,"user":{"displayName":"Ryan Dielhenn","userId":"14414574570994727515"},"user_tz":480},"id":"XaVgK4awRLMv","outputId":"683ec0da-9c04-43eb-e0c5-9e0a7fbfdfdb"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<html>\n","<head><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></head>\n","<body>\n","    <div>            <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_SVG\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\">if (window.MathJax && window.MathJax.Hub && window.MathJax.Hub.Config) {window.MathJax.Hub.Config({SVG: {font: \"STIX-Web\"}});}</script>                <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig: 'local'};</script>\n","        <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.35.2.min.js\"></script>                <div id=\"4861501a-ccb7-40c8-a389-4470a4a5ab47\" class=\"plotly-graph-div\" style=\"height:525px; width:100%;\"></div>            <script type=\"text/javascript\">                                    window.PLOTLYENV=window.PLOTLYENV || {};                                    if (document.getElementById(\"4861501a-ccb7-40c8-a389-4470a4a5ab47\")) {                    Plotly.newPlot(                        \"4861501a-ccb7-40c8-a389-4470a4a5ab47\",                        [{\"customdata\":[[\"Ramp metering that uses traffic signals to regulate vehicle flows from the on-ramps has been widely ...\"],[\"Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach has shown promisein solving complex decis...\"],[\"In this work, we study the protection that fuzzy commitments offer when they are applied to facial i...\"],[\"Portfolio-based algorithm selection has seen tremendous practical success over the past two decades....\"],[\"To quantify how well natural language understanding models can capture consistency in a general conv...\"],[\"Recently, skeleton-based approaches have achieved rapid progress on the basis of great success in sk...\"],[\"In recent years, deep learning has become more and more mature, and as a commonly used algorithm in ...\"],[\"Our routines play an important role in a wide range of social challenges such as climate change, dis...\"],[\"In this paper, we investigate the recommendation task in the most common scenario with implicit feed...\"],[\"Most prominent research today addresses compliance with data protection laws through consumer-centri...\"],[\"Dental caries is one of the most chronic diseases involving the majority of the population during th...\"],[\"Bigdata is a dataset of which size is beyond the ability of handling a valuable raw material that ca...\"],[\"The sample-inefficiency problem in Artificial Intelligence refers to the inability of current Deep R...\"],[\"Significant progress has been made in deep-learning based Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) systems in t...\"],[\"Recently, Nogueira et al.

In deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL), such optimization methods are often used for training neural networks via the temporal difference error or policy gradient. As an agent improves over time, the optimization target changes and thus the loss landscape (and local optima) change. Due to the failure modes of those methods, the ideal choice of optimizer for Deep RL remains unclear. As such, we provide an empirical analysis of the effects that a wide range of gradient descent optimizers and their hyperparameters have on policy gradient methods, a subset of Deep RL algorithms, for benchmark continuous control tasks. We find that adaptive optimizers have a narrow window of effective learning rates, diverging in other cases, and that the effectiveness of momentum varies depending on the properties of the environment. Our analysis suggests that there is significant interplay between the dynamics of the environment and Deep RL algorithm properties which aren't necessarily accounted for by traditional adaptive gradient methods. We provide suggestions for optimal settings of current methods and further lines of research based on our findings.\",\n          \"A number of problems in relational Artificial Intelligence can be viewed as Stochastic Constraint Optimization Problems (SCOPs). These are constraint optimization problems that involve objectives or constraints with a stochastic component. Building on the recently proposed language SC-ProbLog for modeling SCOPs, we propose a new method for solving these problems. Earlier methods used Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) techniques to create Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs), which were decomposed into smaller constraints in order to exploit existing constraint programming (CP) solvers. We argue that this approach has as drawback that a decomposed representation of an OBDD does not guarantee domain consistency during search, and hence limits the efficiency of the solver. For the specific case of monotonic distributions, we suggest an alternative method for using CP in SCOP, based on the development of a new propagator; we show that this propagator is linear in the size of the OBDD, and has the potential to be more efficient than the decomposition method, as it maintains domain consistency.\",\n          \"We consider decision problems under uncertainty where the options available to a decision maker and the resulting outcome are related through a causal mechanism which is unknown to the decision maker. We ask how a decision maker can learn about this causal mechanism through sequential decision making as well as using current causal knowledge inside each round in order to make better choices had she not considered causal knowledge and propose a decision making procedure in which an agent holds \\\\textit{beliefs} about her environment which are used to make a choice and are updated using the observed outcome. As proof of concept, we present an implementation of this causal decision making model and apply it in a simple scenario. We show that the model achieves a performance similar to the classic Q-learning while it also acquires a causal model of the environment.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 14,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Machine Learning Clustering Algorithms']\",\n          \"['Artificial Intelligence in Strategy Games']\",\n          \"['Traffic Signal Control and Prediction']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"docs_short\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Recent analyses of certain gradient descent optimization methods have shown that performance can deg...\",\n          \"A number of problems in relational Artificial Intelligence can be viewed as Stochastic Constraint Op...\",\n          \"We consider decision problems under uncertainty where the options available to a decision maker and ...\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":44}],"source":["df_plot = pd.DataFrame({\n","    \"x1\": [point[0] for point in reduced_embeddings],\n","    \"x2\": [point[1] for point in reduced_embeddings],\n","    \"docs\": docs,\n","    \"label\": all_labels\n","})\n","df_plot[\"docs_short\"] = df_plot[\"docs\"].str[:100] + \"...\"\n","df_plot.head(10)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":45,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":617},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":115,"status":"ok","timestamp":1763626046874,"user":{"displayName":"Ryan Dielhenn","userId":"14414574570994727515"},"user_tz":480},"id":"NB5WDjjHRLM3","outputId":"3c01e1fa-3843-408d-afad-da2e612bfb48"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<html>\n","<head><meta charset=\"utf-8\" /></head>\n","<body>\n","    <div>            <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_SVG\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\">if (window.MathJax && window.MathJax.Hub && window.MathJax.Hub.Config) {window.MathJax.Hub.Config({SVG: {font: \"STIX-Web\"}});}</script>                <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig: 'local'};</script>\n","        <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.35.2.min.js\"></script>                <div id=\"f17abcc3-ffaf-42ff-95e4-e3c1a401418f\" class=\"plotly-graph-div\" style=\"height:600px; width:100%;\"></div>            <script type=\"text/javascript\">                                    window.PLOTLYENV=window.PLOTLYENV || {};                                    if (document.getElementById(\"f17abcc3-ffaf-42ff-95e4-e3c1a401418f\")) {                    Plotly.newPlot(                        \"f17abcc3-ffaf-42ff-95e4-e3c1a401418f\",                        [{\"customdata\":[[\"Ramp metering that uses traffic signals to regulate vehicle flows from the on-ramps has been widely ...\"],[\"Frequent mine disasters cause a large number of casualties and property losses.
