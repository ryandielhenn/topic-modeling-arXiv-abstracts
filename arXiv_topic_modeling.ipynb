    "### Def 1.\n",
    "**Topic modeling** is an **unsupervised machine learning technique** that automatically identifies the abstract topics present within a collection of documents. It assumes that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each topic is characterized by a distribution over words. The goal of topic modeling is to uncover the hidden thematic structure in large textual datasets, facilitating tasks such as organization, summarization, and discovery of patterns without prior annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Def 2.\n",
    "* The problem of modeling text corpora and other collections of discrete data. The goal is to find short descriptions of the members of a collection that enable efficient processing of large collections while preserving the essential statistical relationships that are useful for basic tasks such as classification, novelty detection, summarization, and similarity and relevance judgments.\n",

    "### BERTopic [(🔗)](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html)\n",
    "BERTopic is a topic modeling technique that leverages 🤗 transformers and c-TF-IDF to create dense clusters allowing for easily interpretable topics whilst keeping important words in the topic descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "BERTopic can be viewed as a sequence of steps to create its topic representations. BERTopic generates topics from text through a four-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding**: Each document is first transformed into a numerical vector using a pre-trained language model such as BERT. This step captures the semantic meaning and contextual nuances of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Because the resulting vectors are high-dimensional, a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., UMAP) is applied to simplify the representation while preserving important structure, making clustering more efficient and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clustering**: The reduced vectors are then clustered into groups, where each cluster corresponds to a potential topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Topic Representation**: For each cluster, BERTopic applies a technique called class-based TF-IDF to identify the key words that best characterize the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This end-to-end process enables BERTopic to generate clear, interpretable, and contextually rich topics, often outperforming traditional topic modeling methods.\n"
