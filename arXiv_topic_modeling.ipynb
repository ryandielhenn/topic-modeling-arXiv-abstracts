This step captures the semantic meaning and contextual nuances of the text.\n","\n","2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Because the resulting vectors are high-dimensional, a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., UMAP) is applied to simplify the representation while preserving important structure, making clustering more efficient and effective.\n","\n","3. **Clustering**: The reduced vectors are then clustered into groups, where each cluster corresponds to a potential topic.\n","\n","4. **Topic Representation**: For each cluster, BERTopic applies a technique called class-based TF-IDF to identify the key words that best characterize the topic.\n","\n","This end-to-end process enables BERTopic to generate clear, interpretable, and contextually rich topics, often outperforming traditional topic modeling methods.\n","\n","![image.png](attachment:6c85ca13-6cfa-4a64-9443-bbe4b29e41c2.png)![image.png](attachment:4a208f14-75db-4b07-acb8-c0998be65fe9.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eN9WpI8KRLMu"},"source":["## BERTopic Quick Start\n","\n","### 📄 Loading the Dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"MaDCcduy8iG5","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763602886188,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":5877,"user":{"displayName":"Ryan Dielhenn","userId":"14414574570994727515"}},"outputId":"40394508-62a5-4c4f-8bc0-07b9f965c7dd"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[?25l   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/153.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m153.0/153.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m7.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h"]}],"source":["!pip install -q BERTopic"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"7BlZOPOEEwsR","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1763608110786,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":31609,"user":{"displayName":"Ryan Dielhenn","userId":"14414574570994727515"}},"outputId":"5b6707ba-be93-4e07-a219-06ea9109f966"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n","✅ Imports successful!\n","Error fetching batch at 0: HTTP Error 429: Unknown Error\n"]}],"source":["from bertopic import BERTopic\n","from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","import sys\n","sys.path.insert(0, '/content/drive/MyDrive/CSULA/CS5660/arXiv_topic_modeling')\n","\n","from utils import fetch_arxiv_abstracts\n","\n","print(\"✅ Imports successful!\")\n","\n","\n","\n","docs, titles = fetch_arxiv_abstracts(category='cs.AI', max_results=500)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":137},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":11,"status":"ok","timestamp":1763602961714,"user":{"displayName":"Ryan Dielhenn","userId":"14414574570994727515"},"user_tz":480},"id":"__caSuMD8wYB","outputId":"c6e70064-5c4c-48ab-bc1f-49c05eb1eb9e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Ramp metering that uses traffic signals to regulate vehicle flows from the on-ramps has been widely implemented to improve vehicle mobility of the freeway. Previous studies generally update signal timings in real-time based on predefined traffic measures collected by point detectors, such as traffic volumes and occupancies. Comparing with point detectors, traffic cameras-which have been increasingly deployed on road networks-could cover larger areas and provide more detailed traffic information. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to explore the potential of traffic video data in improving the efficiency of ramp metering. The proposed method uses traffic video frames as inputs and learns the optimal control strategies directly from the high-dimensional visual inputs. A real-world case study demonstrates that, in comparison with a state-of-the-practice method, the proposed DRL method results in 1) lower travel times in the mainline, 2) shorter vehicle queues at the on-ramp, and 3) higher traffic flows downstream of the merging area. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to extract useful information from the video data for better ramp metering controls.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}],"source":["docs[0]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DQuAsXuSRLMu"},"source":["`fetch_20newsgroups` is a function from scikit-learn that loads the 20 Newsgroups dataset, a popular text dataset for machine learning and natural language processing tasks.

In this paper, we contribute to tackling WSC in four ways. Firstly, we suggest a keyword method to define a restricted domain where distinctive high-level semantic patterns can be found. A thanking domain was defined by key-words, and the data set in this domain is used in our experiments. Secondly, we develop a high-level knowledge-based reasoning method using semantic roles which is based on the method of Sharma [2019]. Thirdly, we propose an ensemble method to combine knowledge-based reasoning and machine learning which shows the best performance in our experiments. As a machine learning method, we used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [Kocijan et al., 2019]. Lastly, in terms of evaluation, we suggest a \\\"robust\\\" accuracy measurement by modifying that of Trichelair et al. [2018]. As with their switching method, we evaluate a model by considering its performance on trivial variants of each sentence in the test set.\",\n          \"Recently, neural network based dialogue systems have become ubiquitous in our increasingly digitalized society. However, due to their inherent opaqueness, some recently raised concerns about using neural models are starting to be taken seriously. In fact, intentional or unintentional behaviors could lead to a dialogue system to generate inappropriate responses. Thus, in this paper, we investigate whether we can learn to craft input sentences that result in a black-box neural dialogue model being manipulated into having its outputs contain target words or match target sentences. We propose a reinforcement learning based model that can generate such desired inputs automatically. Extensive experiments on a popular well-trained state-of-the-art neural dialogue model show that our method can successfully seek out desired inputs that lead to the target outputs in a considerable portion of cases. Consequently, our work reveals the potential of neural dialogue models to be manipulated, which inspires and opens the door towards developing strategies to defend them.\",\n          \"Service robots need to reason to support people in daily life situations. Reasoning is an expensive resource that should be used on demand whenever the expectations of the robot do not match the situation of the world and the execution of the task is broken down; in such scenarios the robot must perform the common sense daily life inference cycle consisting on diagnosing what happened, deciding what to do about it, and inducing and executing a plan, recurring in such behavior until the service task can be resumed. Here we examine two strategies to implement this cycle: (1) a pipe-line strategy involving abduction, decision-making and planning, which we call deliberative inference and (2) the use of the knowledge and preferences stored in the robot's knowledge-base, which we call conceptual inference. The former involves an explicit definition of a problem space that is explored through heuristic search, and the latter is based on conceptual knowledge including the human user preferences, and its representation requires a non-monotonic knowledge-based system. We compare the strengths and limitations of both approaches. We also describe a service robot conceptual model and architecture capable of supporting the daily life inference cycle during the execution of a robotics service task. The model is centered in the declarative specification and interpretation of robot's communication and task structure. We also show the implementation of this framework in the fully autonomous robot Golem-III. The framework is illustrated with two demonstration scenarios.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": -1,\n        \"max\": 9,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7,\n          0,\n          8\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"7_fairness_the_in_recommendation\",\n          \"0_the_of_to_and\",\n          \"8_causal_the_of_and\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Representation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Representative_Docs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Top_n_words\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"fairness - the - in - recommendation - and - to - of - users - recommendations - that\",\n          \"the - of - to - and - in - we - that - learning - for - is\",\n          \"causal - the - of - and - in - that - is - causality - to - we\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Probability\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.42512450860810264,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 130,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.684218152464834,\n          0.7521633358157492,\n          0.6998394609355904\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Representative_document\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true,\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}],"source":["topic_model.get_document_info(docs)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LzMRIU4cRLMv"},"source":[" ### Representation Models: Fine-tune Topic Representation\n","\n","BERTopic uses a Bag-of-Words approach with class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) to quickly generate topic keywords without needing to re-train the model after clustering.\n","While this provides good initial topic representations, BERTopic also offers optional representation models for further fine-tuning.\n","These models can range from powerful GPT-like models to faster keyword extraction methods like KeyBERT, giving users flexibility to enhance topic quality as needed."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"g5MaTsy3RLMv"},"source":["### LLM & Generative AI\n","\n","Using LLMs such as GPT-4, and open source soultion, we can fine-tune topics to generate labels, summaries of the topics.\n","\n","- Generate a set of keywords and documetns that describe a topic best using BERTopic's c-TF-IDF .\n","- Candidate keywords and documents are passed to the text generation model and asked to generate output that fits the topic best.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OatGS1vuRLMv"},"source":["#### Prompt\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"qzRLf3TGRLMv"},"outputs":[],"source":["prompt = \"\"\"\n","I have topic that contains the following documents: \\n[DOCUMENTS]\n","The topic is described by the following keywords: [KEYWORDS]\n","\n","Based on the above information, can you give a short label of the topic?\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Zg6s-1ULRLMv"},"source":["### Selecting Documents\n","\n","Four of the most representative documents will be passed to `[Documents]`.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kUB21EkqRLMv"},"source":["![image.png](attachment:a95c2c46-b540-4139-b7ed-afbf9dfe0827.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5J5MztY-RLMv"},"source":["BERTopic works rather straightforward.

In this paper, we contribute to tackling WSC in four ways. Firstly, we suggest a keyword method to define a restricted domain where distinctive high-level semantic patterns can be found. A thanking domain was defined by key-words, and the data set in this domain is used in our experiments. Secondly, we develop a high-level knowledge-based reasoning method using semantic roles which is based on the method of Sharma [2019]. Thirdly, we propose an ensemble method to combine knowledge-based reasoning and machine learning which shows the best performance in our experiments. As a machine learning method, we used Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) [Kocijan et al., 2019]. Lastly, in terms of evaluation, we suggest a \\\"robust\\\" accuracy measurement by modifying that of Trichelair et al. [2018]. As with their switching method, we evaluate a model by considering its performance on trivial variants of each sentence in the test set.\",\n          \"Recently, neural network based dialogue systems have become ubiquitous in our increasingly digitalized society. However, due to their inherent opaqueness, some recently raised concerns about using neural models are starting to be taken seriously. In fact, intentional or unintentional behaviors could lead to a dialogue system to generate inappropriate responses. Thus, in this paper, we investigate whether we can learn to craft input sentences that result in a black-box neural dialogue model being manipulated into having its outputs contain target words or match target sentences. We propose a reinforcement learning based model that can generate such desired inputs automatically. Extensive experiments on a popular well-trained state-of-the-art neural dialogue model show that our method can successfully seek out desired inputs that lead to the target outputs in a considerable portion of cases. Consequently, our work reveals the potential of neural dialogue models to be manipulated, which inspires and opens the door towards developing strategies to defend them.\",\n          \"Service robots need to reason to support people in daily life situations. Reasoning is an expensive resource that should be used on demand whenever the expectations of the robot do not match the situation of the world and the execution of the task is broken down; in such scenarios the robot must perform the common sense daily life inference cycle consisting on diagnosing what happened, deciding what to do about it, and inducing and executing a plan, recurring in such behavior until the service task can be resumed. Here we examine two strategies to implement this cycle: (1) a pipe-line strategy involving abduction, decision-making and planning, which we call deliberative inference and (2) the use of the knowledge and preferences stored in the robot's knowledge-base, which we call conceptual inference. The former involves an explicit definition of a problem space that is explored through heuristic search, and the latter is based on conceptual knowledge including the human user preferences, and its representation requires a non-monotonic knowledge-based system. We compare the strengths and limitations of both approaches. We also describe a service robot conceptual model and architecture capable of supporting the daily life inference cycle during the execution of a robotics service task. The model is centered in the declarative specification and interpretation of robot's communication and task structure. We also show the implementation of this framework in the fully autonomous robot Golem-III. The framework is illustrated with two demonstration scenarios.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"docs_short\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 500,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) is a common-sense reasoning task that requires background knowle...\",\n          \"Recently, neural network based dialogue systems have become ubiquitous in our increasingly digitaliz...\",\n          \"Service robots need to reason to support people in daily life situations.
